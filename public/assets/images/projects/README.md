# Project Images

Please place your project images in this directory.
Ensure the filenames match what is defined in `src/data/projects.js` (or update the js file to match your filenames).

Expected images based on current data:
- `football.webp`
- `image_1.webp`
- `youcommunity.png` (and/or `youcommunity.jpg`)
- `library.jpeg`
- `AeroStream_Analytics.webp`

Note: Some projects currently use external URLs. You can replace them with local images here if you wish, and update `src/data/projects.js`.
